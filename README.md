# Algorithms
This work is to ensure the following:
- Algorithm design
- Performance analysis
- Data structures - basic and advanced

created in Python using PyCharm

# Algorithms, Data Structures
Sorting basic - Bubble, Selection, Insertion
Sorting Advanced - merge, Quick
Big O - complexity analysis
Recursion - in-depth
Search - Biscection, hash map
Data Structures - Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Binary Search Trees

# Sort-performance-complexity-and-big-O-notation
